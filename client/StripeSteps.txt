FrontEnd

start with second tab => Your Hotels
because on the first tab we got nothing to show
we can't show any bookings or browse hotels yet..

second tab => Your Hotels
here user can see their list of hotels already posted
on the right they have a button "+ Add New"
when they click the button, we take them to "/hotels/new"

but before we show any content at all
we need to make sure that the user has completed stripe onboarding/connect
if not, then we show them a button, that will create their account with stripe
without leaving our app, or having them to go to stripe.com
this way, we can get them onboard and create a connected account.
